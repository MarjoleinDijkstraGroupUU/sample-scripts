# Sample simulation scripts

This is a small collection of sample scripts for performing molecular simulations,
in the packages `HOOMD-blue` and `LAMMPS`.

Each directory contains a set of scripts that can be used as a sample or template
for more complex simulations. They are meant to be used as starting points.
