# LAMMPS scripts

- `ljnvt.lammps`: A sample script to run Molecular Dynamics in the NVT ensemble for a 3D system of Lennar-Jones particles at reduced temperature $T^{*}=k_{B} T / \epsilon = 0.85$,
reduced density $\rho \sigma^{3} = 0.9$. This script will create a _restart_ file that can be read by LAMMPS.
