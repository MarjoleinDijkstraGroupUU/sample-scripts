# HOOMD-blue scripts

- `hs-npt.py`: This script contains the necessary code to run a NPT ensemble simulation of pure hard-spheres in 2 dimensions. The extension to 3D is straightforward, because the only thing that needs to be changed is how the initial configuration is created.
    - `analysis.py`: A simple script to plot the change in density for the NPT simulation.
